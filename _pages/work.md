An IBM sponsored an AR project called “Outthink Hidden”.  The project launched inside a new Times AR app. The idea was to make a smartphone into a virtual museum to learn about lesser-known people in the STEM fields using 3D images, video, audio and text that’s activated by AR markers. These markers exist on physical plinths in major cities, as well as on the actual NYT paper. 

It was a creative extension to the movie Hidden Figures, that educates the world on the Fox movie about African-American women working at NASA in the 1960s.

To promote the new, high-performance Lexus IS Hybrid, Logan asked Fake Love to collaborate to create "Trace Your Road". We decided to take the idea of a beautiful stylized commercial, and create a live experiential event that would visually match that.
We ended up with something entirely new and stunning- A life sized real time user generated racetrack made of light.

"Trace Your Road" pits F1 driver Jarno Trulli against a series of improvised racetracks, each one designed on a touch tablet in real-time by one of ten lucky contest winners. The live event took place under high security inside the immense aircraft hangar near Rome, and features the new IS Hybrid, a multitude of cameras, and vast real-time projections.
